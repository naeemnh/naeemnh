## About Me

### Version 1: Balanced

```
About Me

I'm a full stack engineer who genuinely enjoys the whole stack — yes, even debugging CSS.

I learn fast, ship faster, and care about writing code that the next developer
(often future me) won't curse at. I'm drawn to teams building something meaningful,
where quality matters and "it works on my machine" isn't an acceptable answer.

When I'm not coding, I'm probably reading about coding. Working on it.
```

### Version 2: More Earnest

```
About Me

I'm a full stack engineer who believes the best code is the code you don't have to
think about — it just works, it's readable, and it doesn't wake anyone up at 3am.

I've spent the last few years building web applications from database to deployment.
I'm happiest when I'm solving interesting problems with people who care about
getting the details right.

I'm currently looking for my next role — ideally somewhere I can learn from great
engineers while shipping work I'm proud of.
```

### Version 3: Shorter

```
About Me

Full stack engineer. I build web applications from the database up to the pixels,
and I care about doing it well.

Looking for a team that ships quality work and doesn't think "move fast and
break things" applies to production.
```

## Experience

_[You'll need to fill in specifics — here's the format and tone]_

### Template

```
Experience

**[Job Title]**
[Company Name] • [Start] - [End/Present]

[One sentence about what the company does if not obvious]
[2-3 sentences about what YOU did — focus on impact, not just tasks]

Example:
"Built and maintained the customer-facing dashboard used by 50k+ users.
Led the migration from REST to GraphQL, reducing average page load by 40%.
Collaborated with design to implement a component library that's still in use."
```

### Tone Tips

- Lead with what you built or achieved, not what you were "responsible for"
- Include numbers when you have them (users, performance gains, team size)
- It's okay to show personality: "Inherited a legacy codebase and didn't mass-quit"
- Keep each role to 2-4 lines max

## My Work / Projects

### Section Header

**Instead of:** "A collection of projects I've built and contributed to."

**Use one of these:**

- "Things I've built (that I'm not embarrassed to show you)"
- "Selected Work"
- "Projects — the ones I'm proudest of"
- "What I've Been Building"

### Project Card Copy Template

```
**[Project Name]**

[One sentence: what it is and what problem it solves]
[One sentence: what's interesting about how you built it OR what you learned]

Tech: [React, Node.js, etc.]

[View Project →]
```

### Example Project Descriptions

**Project 1: Task Management App**

**Project 2: API Integration Tool**

## Blog

### Section Header

**Instead of:** "Thoughts, tutorials, and insights on web development and technology."

**Use one of these:**

- "Writing — mostly about code, occasionally about everything else"
- "Blog — things I've learned, often the hard way"
- "Notes & Tutorials"
- "Thinking Out Loud"

### Blog Post Title Ideas

_Instead of "My First Blog Post," write about something specific:_

- "What I Learned Migrating to TypeScript (And What I'd Do Differently)"
- "A Simple Pattern for Handling API Errors in React"
- "Why I Rebuilt My Portfolio Site (Again)"
- "Notes on [Book/Technology/Concept]"
- "How I Approach Debugging"

## Connect With Me / Social Links

**Instead of just icons, consider:**

```
Connect With Me

LinkedIn — let's be professional
GitHub — see how I actually code
Twitter/X — occasional thoughts [if you use it]
```

**Or keep it minimal:**

```
Find me on LinkedIn and GitHub, or just email me.
```

---

## Download Resume

**Instead of:** "Download PDF"

**Try:**

- "Download Resume (PDF)"
- "Grab my resume"
- "Resume — the formal version"

## CLI Version Teaser Copy

```
> Switching to terminal mode...

## General Tone Notes

**Do:**

- Be specific over generic
- Show personality without forcing it
- Write like you're talking to a smart friend
- Lead with what makes you interesting

**Don't:**

- Use buzzwords: "passionate," "synergy," "leverage"
- Oversell: "revolutionary," "cutting-edge," "world-class"
- Be self-deprecating to the point of undermining yourself
- Write long paragraphs — break them up

**Your voice should feel:**

- Competent but not cocky
- Warm but professional
- Clever but clear

---

## Next Steps

1. Pick one option from each section (or mix and match)
2. Fill in your actual experience and project details
3. Read it out loud — if it sounds stiff, loosen it up
4. Get a friend to read it — do they hear _you_ in it?

Good luck, Naeem! 🚀
